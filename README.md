A multi-purpose Discord bot written in Python using [Disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) with the aim to be heavily customizable*
>*Not fully implemented yet *(ironic)*, read "[Project Plans](#project-plans)" or "[todo.md](./todo.md)"

<br />

**Huge thanks to [Caeden PH](https://github.com/CaedenPH) and contributors for making [JesterBot](https://github.com/CaedenPH/JesterBot), which the structure and most functionality of this bot was heavily inspired by. Please go check out their repository!**

# Inviting/Hosting ForeignBot

>[!IMPORTANT]
>**Theres no official invite link at the moment!** See [why](#prototyping-phase).

>[!CAUTION]
>**HOSTING YOUR OWN FOREIGNBOT INSTANCE IS NOT ADVISED DURING THE PROTOTYPING PHASE, FEATURES WILL BE MISSING AND BUGS WILL BE PRESENT! ONLY DO THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION!**

# Prototyping Phase
This stage of development is rocky! During this stage I'm mainly focused on seeing what sticks and what doesn't. **That means there will be no official public instance of ForeignBot yet.**

<br />
Optimization and efficiency is my second priority during this time, if you find bugs or propose a better method to my madness, please open an [issue].

Keep in mind the source code during this time will look chaotic, as updates go along and new features are added the source code will be more and more presentable.

# Project Plans
Here's a list of what I have planned for future features, explained in more detail compared to the [todo.md](./todo.md) file.
<br />

If anything ends with a question mark then it isn't fully decided whether it will be added or not. No guarantees!
<br />
Order is not important, but anything **bolded** is considered a higher priority. However [todo.md](./todo.md) follows a structural heirarchy.


- Moderation
  - 
  - Create the moderation cog and basic moderation commands.
- Economy
  - 
  - Better shop handling and inventory management.
  - Simulated stock market where users can invest in fake stocks for ForeignCoins?
    - *Maybe add the ability for users to create their own stocks that other users can invest in with a certain amount of ForeignCoins?*
- Miscellaneous
  - 
  - More robust achievement handling, current system is held together by hopes and dreams.
    - *Remove the achievement system?*
  - **Add the entire gimmick of this Discord bot, customization.**
  - The ability to actually use items, only item with any current ability is the Scary Mask.
